## FizzBuzz in Assembly

I've always been afraid of assembly due to it's complexity, but at the same time amazed of programmers who can code in it.
So why not give it a try? The first time I made a syscall following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDiaZS-2ok) made by [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelTV)
was very satisfying so I decided that I should at least write some programs in assembly. Now I'm finally able to write FizzBuzz in x86 64bit
Linux Assembly (not pure since I'm using libc). It might not be written in the best way possible but I did it xD.
